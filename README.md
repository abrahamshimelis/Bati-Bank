# Project: Credit Scoring Model for Buy-Now-Pay-Later Service

## Overview
This project aims to create a Credit Scoring Model using the data provided by an eCommerce platform. The model will enable a buy-now-pay-later service by evaluating the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. The result is either a score representing the creditworthiness of an applicant or a prediction of whether an applicant will default in the future.

## Features
The product built in this project will have the following features:

1. **Risk Categorization**: Define a proxy variable that can be used to categorize users as high risk (bad) or low risk (good).

2. **Feature Selection**: Select observable features that are good predictors (have high correlation) of the default variable defined above.

3. **Risk Probability Model**: Develop a model that assigns risk probability for a new customer.

4. **Credit Score Assignment**: Develop a model that assigns credit score from risk probability estimates.
